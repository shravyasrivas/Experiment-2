Aim: Study of Lists in Python
Algorithm:
Algorithm for Question 1:
Step1:Start
Step2:Create a list names with given student names
Step3:Print the first and last name using index positions
Step4:Insert a new name at the given position using insert()
Step5:Remove a specific name using remove()
Step6:Sort the list in ascending order using sort()
Step7:Display the final list
STep8:Stop

Algorithm for Question 2:
Start
Create a list studentmarks with marks of students
Find the minimum marks using min()
Find the maximum marks using max()
Calculate the average using sum()/len()
Sort the marks in ascending order using sort()
Display all results
Stop


Theory :
In this experiment, I studied Lists in Python. A list is a collection of elements that can store multiple values in a single variable. Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. Elements in a list can be accessed using their index number.
Functions and Concepts Used:

append()
Used to add an element at the end of the list.
Example: listfruits.append("blue berry")

insert()
Used to insert an element at a specific index position.
Example: listfruits.insert(1, "banana")

remove()
used to remove a specific element from the list.
Example: names.remove("Riya")

len()
Used to find the number of elements in a list.
Example: len(listfruits)

sort()
Used to arrange elements in ascending (alphabetical) order.
Example: names.sort()

max() and min()
Used to find the highest and lowest values in a list
Example: max(studentmarks), min(studentmarks)

sum()
used to calculate the total of all elements in a numeric list.

Slicing:
used to access a part of the list.
Example: list1[2:7], list1[:5], list1[-3:]

extend()
Used to combine one list with another list.



Conclusion
From this experiment, I learned how to create and use lists in Python. I understood how to add, remove, replace, and sort elements in a list. I also learned how to find the highest, lowest, and average values using built-in functions. This experiment helped me understand list operations clearly and improved my confidence in using Python lists for solving problems.
