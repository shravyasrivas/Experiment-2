# Experiment 2:

---

### Aim: Study of Lists in Python

---

### Algorithms

#### Algorithm for Question 1:

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a list names with student names.

Step 3: Print the first and last name using indexing.

Step 4: Insert a new name at the given position using insert().

Step 5: Remove a specific name using remove().

Step 6: Sort the list in ascending order using sort().

Step 7: Display the final list.

Step 8: Stop.

#### Algorithm for Question 2:

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a list studentmarks with marks of students.

Step 3: Find the minimum marks using min().

Step 4: Find the maximum marks using max().

Step 5: Calculate the average using sum()/len().

Step 6: Sort the marks in ascending order using sort().

Step 7: Display results.

Step 8: Stop.

### Theory

A list is a collection of elements that can store multiple values in a single variable. Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. Elements in a list can be accessed using their index number.

---

### Functions

**append()**:
Used to add an element at the end of the list.
Example: listfruits.append("blue berry")

**insert()**:
Used to insert an element at a specific index position.
Example: listfruits.insert(1, "banana")

**remove()**:
used to remove a specific element from the list.
Example: names.remove("Riya")

**len()**:
Used to find the number of elements in a list.
Example: len(listfruits)

**sort()**:
Used to arrange elements in ascending (alphabetical) order.
Example: names.sort()

**max() and min()**:
Used to find the highest and lowest values in a list
Example: max(studentmarks), min(studentmarks)

**sum()**:
Used to calculate the total of all elements in a numeric list.

**extend()**:
Used to combine one list with another list.

---

### Methods

**Slicing**:
Used to access a part of the list.
Example: list1[2:7]

---

### Conclusion

From this experiment, we learned how to create and use lists in Python. We understood how to add, remove, replace, and sort elements in a list. We also learned how to find the highest, lowest, and average values using built-in functions. This experiment helped us understand list operations clearly.
